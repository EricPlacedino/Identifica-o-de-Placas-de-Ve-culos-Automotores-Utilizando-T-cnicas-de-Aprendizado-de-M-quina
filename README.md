To replace the path of `Tesseract.exe` in `thread.py`, follow these steps:

1. Open `thread.py` in your code editor.
2. Locate the section of the code where the path to `Tesseract.exe` is defined.
3. Replace the existing path with the new path.

For example, if the current code looks like this:

pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\Old\Path\Tesseract.exe'

And the new path is `C:\New\Path\Tesseract.exe`, update the code to:

pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\New\Path\Tesseract.exe'


Save the file after making the change.

If you need a more specific translation based on a detailed context or an additional step-by-step guide, please provide more details from `thread.py`.
